        <h1>What is SOC? and Key Functions in Cybersecurity</h1>
        <small>Posted: Aug 2, 2025 |  at  03:20 PM</small>
        <p>Hey Everyone, Collins here.</p>
        <p>In today's digital world, cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, targeting businesses, governments, and individuals. To defend against these evolving threats, organizations establish a <strong>Security Operations Center (SOC)</strong> — the command facility for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.</p>
        <p>By definition a Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit within an organization that continuously monitors and analyzes security events in real-time. Its main purpose is to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats before they cause significant damage to the organization and its assets.</p>
        <P>Think of a SOC as your organization's dedicated first responders. It's the central spot where skilled people, smart processes, and powerful tech come together to continuously watch for threats ,investigate alerts and take action when needed.</P>
        <h2>What does a SOC do? Key functions of a SOC.</h2>
        <P>SOC operations provide surveillance monitoring across the entire digital landscape - endpoints, servers, networks, cloud assets, the works.</P>
        <p>Here are some key functions of a SOC:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong> - The SOC makes use of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools like Splunk, EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), and NDR (Network Detection and Response) to detect suspicious behaviors in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response (IR)</strong> - Once an incident has been verified,SOC takes steps to contain and eradicate threats to minimize impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Alert Triage</strong> -The SOC monitors the traffic network logs and events, filters these, distinguishing false positives from legitimate threats, prioritizing effectively, and crucially, reducing alert fatigue for the analysts.</li>
            <li><strong>Threat Hunting</strong>SOC Leverages on real-time threat feeds, IOCs (Indicators of Compromise - like malicious IPs or file hashes), TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures - how attackers operate, often mapped to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK®), and threat actor profiling to enhance both detection and response capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting and DOcumentation</strong> - As a SOC Keeping records for compliance and future analysis is an essential skill</li>
        </ul>
